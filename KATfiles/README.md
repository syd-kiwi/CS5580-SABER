# KAT Files for SABER Implementation

## Overview
This directory contains **Known Answer Test (KAT) files** for the **SABER** and **LightSaber** key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) implementations. These files are used to validate the correctness of the algorithm by comparing output values against expected results.

## Usage
- These files are used to verify the **correctness and consistency** of the SABER algorithm.
- They serve as reference outputs when running tests on different implementations.
- Can be used in debugging and validation during cryptographic analysis.
