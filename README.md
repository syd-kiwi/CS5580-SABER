# Saber Cryptographic Implementation

Source code repo containing CS 5580 - Group 5's Spring 2025 semester project source code

This repository contains a clean and efficient C implementation of the Saber key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM), a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm candidate in the NIST PQC standardization project. Saber is based on the Module Learning With Rounding (Module-LWR) problem.

Features

* Implementation of key generation, encapsulation, and decapsulation procedures.
* Includes KAT test cases to verify correct functionality.
